Abstract
 
1. Trait-based ecology can reveal the processes and mechanisms shaping biodiversity patterns, but approaches to integrate species interactions and traits across trophic levels and large-scale environmental gradients remain scarce. In multitrophic assemblages of producers (e.g. plants) and consumers (e.g. animals), the trait composition of species at one trophic level can influence the trait composition of species at the other trophic level, e.g. via trait matching. However, abiotic variation along large-scale environmental gradients may show different constraints on traits and functional composition of species assemblages at different trophic levels, setting potential limits to trait matching and the availability of interaction-relevant traits. Such functional trophic asymmetry could influence both the assembly of multitrophic communities and the pattern of pairwise interactions, imposing a constraint on network structure.

2. Here, we define functional trophic asymmetry as the relative divergences between consumer (animal) and resource (plant) assemblages in their (1) functional trait richness, and (2) functional trait evenness. We investigate how functional trophic asymmetry varies along climatic gradients to infer processes shaping limits to species interaction niches. We exemplify this concept with multitrophic networks of mammalian frugivores (consumers) and palms (resources) across the Neotropics. We relate the functional trophic asymmetry of these assemblages to geographic variation in climate, and to regional biogeographic and evolutionary history. Moreover, we build structural equation models (SEMs) to test whether the effects of climate on the topology of palm-frugivore interaction networks are mediated by functional trophic asymmetry.

3. Functional trophic asymmetry, especially the differences in functional evenness between trophic levels, was greatest in regions with low annual rainfall and extended dry seasons. Furthermore, the influence of climatic gradients on functional trophic asymmetry differed among biogeographic regions, suggesting that multitrophic community assembly is governed by the interaction between contemporary climate and biogeographic history. SEMs showed that variation of functional trophic asymmetry along climatic gradients generates predictable changes in network topology. 

4. Our approach to measuring functional trophic asymmetry along climatic gradients helped to reveal multitrophic assembly processes and their influence on network specialization. Specifically, a stronger filtering of palm traits relative to frugivore traits in arid environments implies greater levels of constraint on partner associations for consumers. However, plant-frugivore networks were also less specialized in arid environments, which suggests that global aridification in the face of climate change could lead to the loss of species with few interacting partners.
